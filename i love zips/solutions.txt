[SPOILER ALERT]
































































































# It's really the first CTF challenge I've ever made, so sorry if there are some errors.

Writeup:

There is a file called "unzip_me_999.zip". Seems pretty straightforward. Let's unzip it.

There is another zip file inside "unzip_me_999.zip". named "unzip_me_998.zip". Continue unzipping it.

If you use a python code, you should be able to unzip all the way, until you are stuck with an error as "unzip_me_538.zip" can't be unzipped.

You realise that it is password protected, and in the "unzip_me_539.zip" file, there is a list of random lettered strings.

Brute force the file using a script with each line of the text file.

After it is successfully unlocked with a specific line in the text file (let that string be _password_), continue unzipping it until you have reached the last text file.

Put the entire fake flag into a vignere cipher, using _password_ as the key. How would we know that is in a vignere cipher? Google "Men and victims, salt and fire." in the challenge flag file. You will see something related to Blaise de vignere.

You will get your flag!


Random Notes / How I made this:

Password of zip file: Line 52 of passwords.txt: uenCNfvxdltFSYKIQcmORTsqk
 
Using Vignere Cipher and Password of zip file as key, (https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher)
YBN{1_h4t3_z1pp5_g3t_m3_fl4G} => SFA{1_j4g3_e1km5_j3e_f3_kd4E}
